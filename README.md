# MultipleChoice2SBG
A Google Sheet + Gapps Script that automatically converts GradeCam export data (or manually multiple choice data) to user defined standard scores with rubric customization support.


The current iteration of the file (V1.3) can be copied at the following link:

I'm not aware of a nice way to import the actual code into GIT, so I will only link the existing program for now. Please mind the GNUGPB3.0 License.
